# AVL Tree
## Objectives
- Learn how to implement a Binary Search Tree and its operations.
- Learn how to create a perfectly balanced search tree.
- Learn how to implement rotation operations and the balancing algorithm to obtain balanced trees (AVL Tree).

## Description
Implement the ADT AVLTree[K]. An AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree. The practice will be structured in two stages:

1. The first stage should implement only the binary search tree operations: location, insertion and deletion of keys and generation of a perfectly balanced tree with all the keys known.

2. In the second stage, the rotation operations necessary to balance the tree and the balancing algorithm must be implemented.
