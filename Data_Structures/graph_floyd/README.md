# Floyd's Algorithm
Implementation of Floyd's algorithm to find the shortest path that connects any pair of vertices in a graph.

## Objectives
- Implement WGraph<T>, by adding vertices and sides to the graph.
- Implement the function that displays a graph from an input stream.
- Implement the function that obtains the weight matrix W from the side.
- Implement the floyd algorithm to obtain the matrices D and I.
- Implement the function that obtains the path to follow given the matrix I.
