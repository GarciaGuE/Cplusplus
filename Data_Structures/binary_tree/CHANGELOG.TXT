1.0
- First version.
1.1
- tests_btree: test 10 correction.
1.2
- Corrected error of traversal tests using the search for a value.
  By using a single std::cout << expression to
  run the traversal and print the "count" value, depending on the version
  of the compiler, "count" can be evaluated before running the traversal and therefore
  both the value that comes out is the initial value of 0. It is corrected by separating into two
  std::cout << expressions, the first does the traversal and the second prints the
  count value modified by the lambda function.
