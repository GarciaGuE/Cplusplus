# C++ Cognitive Projects
Collection of projects is focused on exploring and implementing intelligent systems using the C++ programming language. 

## Projects Included
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe:** An AI implementation that plays the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human opponent. Here we find the game implemented in order to play with the machine or spend time on train it.

2. **N-Queens Solver:** A program to find solutions to the N-Queens problem, which is a classic combinatorial problem often used in artificial intelligence.
